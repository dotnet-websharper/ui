# Contributing

WebSharper is a Free Software project, and we welcome your contributions!

[The UI repository](https://github.com/dotnet-websharper/ui) contains the WebSharper.UI reactive programming and HTML libraries. WebSharper consists of this repository as well as a constellation of libraries and extensions, located [in the `dotnet-websharper` GitHub organization](https://github.com/dotnet-websharper). Don't hesitate to contribute to these too!

## What to contribute?

We welcome all types of contributions, particularly:

* Bug fixes in [the issue tracker](https://github.com/dotnet-websharper/ui/issues)
* Library improvements
* Feature suggestions are welcome on [the Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/intellifactory/websharper) and [the issue tracker](https://github.com/dotnet-websharper/ui/issues); we suggest that you discuss new features with the rest of the team on these channels before getting started on implementation.

## How to contribute

<a name="requirements"></a>
### Required software

It is possible to work on WebSharper on Windows, Linux and OSX.

To compile this project, you need the following installed:

* The .NET SDK 6.0.10 or newer. You can download it [here](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download).

<a name="devenv"></a>
### Setting up your development environment

We recommend that you use one of the following development environments:

* On Windows: [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/).
* On all platforms: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the following extensions:
  * `ionide-fsharp` for F# support
  * `ms-vscode.csharp` for C# support

### Configure WebSharper packages
There are two options:
* WebSharper GitHub packages feed
* Locally built WebSharper packages

### Configure GitHub packages feed
To get non-public builds of WebSharper, you need to access GitHub packages which requires a Personal Access Token (PAT).

Create a new token ensuring it has the read:packages scope [like this](https://docs.github.com/pt/packages/learn-github-packages/introduction-to-github-packages#authenticating-to-github-packages).

You can test your PAT by accessing https://nuget.pkg.github.com/dotnet-websharper/index.json and providing your github user name and the PAT as the password.

Then to configure Paket source authentication, run:
* `dotnet tool restore`
* `dotnet paket config add-credentials https://nuget.pkg.github.com/dotnet-websharper/index.json --username <ghUser> --password <PAT>` (use your GitHub user name and PAT)

To add WebSharper GitHub packages as a nuget source to browse from Visual Studio, run:
* `dotnet nuget add source https://nuget.pkg.github.com/dotnet-websharper/index.json --name dotnet-websharper-GitHub --username <ghUser> --password <PAT>`

### Use locally built WebSharper packages

* Clone `core` and `ui` repos under the same root, also create a third sub-directory called `localnuget`.
* Build WebSharper with `build ws-package` then copy all `build/*.nupkg` files to `localnuget`.
* Run `build ws-update` in the `ui` folder. Now it is using your local WebSharper build.

<a name="build-cli"></a>
### Building from the command line

This project can be built using the script `build.cmd` on Windows, or `build.sh` on Linux andr OSX.
In the following shell snippets, a command line starting with `build` means `.\build.cmd` on Windows and `./build.sh` on Linux and OSX.

Simply running `build` compiles the UI libraries and tests in debug mode. The following targets are available:

* `build ws-builddebug`

    Equivalent to simple `build`: compiles the libraries and tests in debug mode.

* `build ws-buildrelease`

    Compiles the libraries and tests in release mode.

* `build ws-package`

    Compiles the libraries and tests in release mode, then creates NuGet packages in the `build` folder.

* `build ws-clean`

    Deletes temporary and output directories.

* `build ci-release`

    Full build as is used for releases. Update non-fixed dependencies, build everything, run unit tests, package.

The following options are available:

* `build [TARGET] -ef verbose`

    Makes compilation more verbose. Equivalently, set the `verbose` environment variable to `true`.

### Running the tests

WebSharper defines and uses its own test framework, WebSharper.Testing. It runs on the client side and is backed by [qUnit](https://qunitjs.com/). So running the WebSharper test suite consists in running a web application which looks like this:

![Unit testing screenshot](https://github.com/dotnet-websharper/core/raw/master/docs/qunit.png)

This repository contains several test projects, detailed in the [project structure](#structure). They are ASP.NET applications hosting WebSharper applications; some of them are Client-Server applications, others are SPAs. Here is how to run them:

* If you are using Visual Studio, you can simply open `WebSharper.UI.sln`, set the test project you want as the startup project, and Run.

* On Linux or OSX, you can browse into the project's folder and simply run `xsp`.

### Project structure

Here is the detail of the project structure:

* Libraries:
  * `WebSharper.UI` contains the core library for both reactive programming and DOM management.
  * `WebSharper.UI.CSharp` contains the C#-friendly API for `WebSharper.UI`.
