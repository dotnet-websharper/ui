# Roadmap
 
Overall, two problems in scope:

1. Dynamic data-flow graph - see [Dataflow](Dataflow.md)

2. Its integration with DOM, and motivating examples - see
   [DOM](DOM.md)

Objective: produce WebSharper, JavaScript and TypeScript variants of
the library.

Smaller problems in scope:

* API for memoization and incremental computation in the dataflow
  graph

* A DSL for specifying transition animations (as in D3.js), including
  "enter" and "exit"

* A few combinators for flowlet-like composition

* Simple to use HTML5 vocabulary, SVG, etc, similar to D3
